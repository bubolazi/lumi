## Getting Started

### Option 1: Direct File Access
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

### Option 2: Local Server
For the best experience, serve the files using a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
